# Figmentator Web Service

A figmentator generates figments of the imagination, i.e. suggestions for where
to take a story next.


## Usage

There are are currently three environments: dev, stage, & prod. Run `make
build-dev` or `make build-prod` to create the docker containers to deploy the
service.

Afterward you can run `deploy-dev` or `make deploy-prod` to start the service.
